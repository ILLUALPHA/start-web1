    <h2>Css</h2>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
       [3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
       provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
       enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
        which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
        css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>
       <img src="css.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
       for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
       and on Braille-based tactile devices.
       CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
